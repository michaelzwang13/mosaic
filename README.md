# Mosaic

## Overview

Everyone has their own unique slice of life. From hobbies, favorite shows, and even personal recipes,
each person is composed of a mosaic of their own unique experiences and interests. 

Currently, there are no good ways to express this to the world. Instagram can be too curated and 
revealing, while LinkedIn is heavily career related and doesn't really show the other side of 
us human beings.

Mosaic is a web app that allows users to create a profile of themselves with the help of widgets
that can snap into a preset grid. People can choose from a variety of different blocks, ranging 
from a Youtube video, an inspirational quote, or even their favorite photo. The sheer customizability
means that users can reveal as much as they want, or as little as they want. The end goal is to 
share another side of themselves to the world that isn't so easy to do so otherwise. Users can 
register and login and also look at trending mosaics on their home page.
